Hello and welcome to my personal website !
I am currently conducting research at Applied Research Labratories, where I am utilizing
unsupervised-deep learning for classification of sonar imagery.
I am also pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science from UT Austin, where I am focusing in 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
